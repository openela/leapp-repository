    Update the firewalld Lockdown Whitelist.

    OL-8 uses a platform specific python interpreter for packaged
    applications. For firewall-config, the interpreter path is part of the
    lockdown list. In OL-7 this was simply /usr/bin/python, but in OL-8
    it's /usr/libexec/platform-python. However, if the user made changes to the
    lockdown whitelist it won't be replaced by RPM/dnf. As such we must update
    the interpreter if the old value is there.
